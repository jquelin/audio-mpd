no time plan associated - not even an order implied.

the indication in parens forecasts the difficulty / bump in version implied.
can be either minor, medium or major.


** distribution:

- sign module using Module::Signature.


** module cleaning

- creating AM::Stats, on the same model than AM::Status, since a plain
  hash ref is quite ugly to manipulate, and not encapsulated


** module enhancements

- implementing missing methods in am::collection (random, etc.)
- extending and harmonizing subs in am::playlist (add() should allow
  multiple arguments, for example)
- what about improving am::status to allow for auto-update?


** dialog with mpd

- more extensive coverage of supported mpd instruction set.
- better communication with mpd (including auto-reconnect).


** mpd scripts:

- mpd proxy adding song ratings on-the-fly.
- small daemon watching collcetion dir (inotify) and updating mpd
