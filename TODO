no time plan associated - not even an order implied.


** distribution:

- sign module using Module::Signature.


** module enhancements

- implementing missing methods in am::collection (random, etc.)
    . artists_matching (yup, no way to have it with mpd's api)
    . albums_matching (ditto)
    . random_song / random_songs
    . songs_by_artist_from_album
    . songs_by_artist_without_album
    . songs_without_artist
- extending and harmonizing subs in am::playlist (add() should allow
  multiple arguments, for example)
- what about improving am::* to allow for auto-update?


** dialog with mpd

- more extensive coverage of supported mpd instruction set.
- better communication with mpd (including auto-reconnect).


** mpd scripts:

- mpd proxy adding song ratings on-the-fly.
- small daemon watching collection dir (inotify) and updating mpd
