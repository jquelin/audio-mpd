# Constructor

#
# my $collection = Audio::MPD::Playlist->new( _mpd => $mpd );
#
# This will create the object, holding a back-reference to the Audio::MPD
# object itself (for communication purposes). But in order to play safe and
# to free the memory in time, this reference is weakened.
#
# Note that you're not supposed to call this constructor yourself, an
# Audio::MPD::Playlist is automatically created for you during the creation
# of an Audio::MPD object.
