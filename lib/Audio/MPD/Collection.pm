# Constructor

#
# my $collection = Audio::MPD::Collection->new( _mpd => $mpd );
#
# This will create the object, holding a back-reference to the Audio::MPD
# object itself (for communication purposes). But in order to play safe and
# to free the memory in time, this reference is weakened.
#
# Note that you're not supposed to call this constructor yourself, an
# Audio::MPD::Collection is automatically created for you during the creation
# of an Audio::MPD object.

=head1 NAME

Audio::MPD::Collection - class to query MPD's collection

=head1 VERSION

version 1.112670

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my @songs = $mpd->collection->all_songs;
    # and lots of other methods

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Audio::MPD::Collection> is a class meant to access & query MPD's
collection. You will be able to use those high-level methods instead
of using the low-level methods provided by mpd itself.

Note that you're not supposed to call the constructor yourself, an
L<Audio::MPD::Collection> is automatically created for you during the
creation of an L<Audio::MPD> object - it can then be used with the
C<collection()> accessor.

=head1 RETRIEVING SONGS & DIRECTORIES

=head2 all_items

    my @items = $coll->all_items( [$path] );

Return B<all> L<Audio::MPD::Common::Item>s (both songs & directories)
currently known by mpd.

If C<$path> is supplied (relative to mpd root), restrict the retrieval to
songs and dirs in this directory.

=head2 all_items_simple

    my @items = $coll->all_items_simple( [$path] );

Return B<all> L<Audio::MPD::Common::Item>s (both songs & directories)

If C<$path> is supplied (relative to mpd root), restrict the retrieval to
songs and dirs in this directory.

B</!\ Warning>: the L<Audio::MPD::Common::Item::Song> objects will only
have their tag C<file> filled. Any other tag will be empty, so don't use
this sub for any other thing than a quick scan!

=head2 items_in_dir

    my @items = $coll->items_in_dir( [$path] );
