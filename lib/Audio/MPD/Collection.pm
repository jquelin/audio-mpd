=head1 NAME

Audio::MPD::Collection - an object to query MPD's collection


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $song = $mpd->collection->random_song;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Audio::MPD::Collection> is a class meant to access & query MPD's
collection. You will be able to use those high-level methods instead
of using the low-level methods provided by mpd itself.


=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item new( $mpd )

This will create the object, holding a back-reference to the C<Audio::MPD>
object itself (for communication purposes). But in order to play safe and
to free the memory in time, this reference is weakened.

Note that you're not supposed to call this constructor yourself, an
C<Audio::MPD::Collection> is automatically created for you during the creation
of an C<Audio::MPD> object.

=back


=head2 Retrieving songs & directories

=over 4

=item $coll->all_items( [$path] )

Return B<all> C<Audio::MPD::Common::Item>s (both songs & directories)

any other thing than a quick scan!


=item $coll->items_in_dir( [$path] )

Return the items in the given C<$path>. If no C<$path> supplied, do it on
mpd's root directory.

=item $coll->all_songs( [$path] )

Return B<all> C<Audio::MPD::Common::Item::Song>s currently known by mpd.
