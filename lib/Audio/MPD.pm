=head1 NAME

Audio::MPD - class to talk to MPD (Music Player Daemon) servers


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Audio::MPD;

    my $mpd = Audio::MPD->new();
    $mpd->play();
    sleep 10;
    $mpd->next();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Audio::MPD gives a clear object-oriented interface for talking to and
controlling MPD (Music Player Daemon) servers. A connection to the MPD
server is established as soon as a new Audio::MPD object is created.

Note that the module will by default connect to mpd before sending any
command, and will disconnect after the command has been issued. This scheme
is far from optimal, but allows us not to care about timeout disconnections.

B</!\> Note that Audio::MPD is using high-level, blocking sockets. This
means that if the mpd server is slow, or hangs for whatever reason, or
even crash abruptly, the program will be hung forever in this sub. The
POE::Component::Client::MPD module is way safer - you're advised to use
it instead of Audio::MPD. Or you can try to set C<conntype> to C<$REUSE>
(see Audio::MPD constructor for more details), but you would be then on
your own to deal with disconnections.


=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item new( [%opts] )

This is the constructor for Audio::MPD. One can specify the following
options:

=over 4

=item hostname => C<$hostname>

defaults to environment var MPD_HOST, then to 'localhost'. Note that
MPD_HOST can be of the form password@host.

=item port => C<$port>

defaults to environment var MPD_PORT, then to 6600.

=item password => $password

defaults to environment var MPD_PASSWORD, then to ''.

=item conntype => $type

change how the connection to mpd server is handled. It can be either
C<$REUSE> to reuse the same connection or C<$ONCE> to open a new
connection per command (default)

=back


=back


=head2 Controlling the server

=over 4

=item $mpd->ping()

Sends a ping command to the mpd server.


=item $mpd->version()

Return mpd's version number as advertised during connection. Note that
mpd returns B<protocol> version when connected. This protocol version
can differ from the real mpd version. eg, mpd version 0.13.2 is
"speaking" and thus advertising version 0.13.0.



=item $mpd->kill()

Send a message to the MPD server telling it to shut down.


=item $mpd->password( [$password] )

Change password used to communicate with MPD server to $password.
Empty string is assumed if $password is not supplied.


=item $mpd->updatedb( [$path] )

Force mpd to recan its collection. If $path (relative to MPD's music directory)
is supplied, MPD will only scan it - otherwise, MPD will rescan its whole
collection.


=item $mpd->urlhandlers()

Return an array of supported URL schemes.


=back


=head2 Handling volume & output

=over 4

=item $mpd->volume( [+][-]$volume )

Sets the audio output volume percentage to absolute $volume.
If $volume is prefixed by '+' or '-' then the volume is changed relatively
by that value.


=item $mpd->output_enable( $output )

Enable the specified audio output. $output is the ID of the audio output.


=item $mpd->output_disable( $output )

Disable the specified audio output. $output is the ID of the audio output.

=back


=head2 Retrieving info from current state

=over 4

=item $mpd->stats()

Return an C<Audio::MPD::Common::Stats> object with the current statistics
of MPD. See the associated pod for more information.


=item $mpd->status()

Return an C<Audio::MPD::Common::Status> object with various information on
current MPD server settings. Check the embedded pod for more information on
the available accessors.


=item $mpd->current()

Return an C<Audio::MPD::Common::Item::Song> representing the song currently
playing.


=item $mpd->song( [$song] )

Return an C<Audio::MPD::Common::Item::Song> representing the song number
C<$song>. If C<$song> is not supplied, returns the current song.


=item $mpd->songid( [$songid] )

Return an C<Audio::MPD::Common::Item::Song> representing the song with id
C<$songid>. If C<$songid> is not supplied, returns the current song.

=back


=head2 Altering MPD settings

=over 4

=item $mpd->repeat( [$repeat] )

Set the repeat mode to $repeat (1 or 0). If $repeat is not specified then
the repeat mode is toggled.


=item $mpd->random( [$random] )

Set the random mode to $random (1 or 0). If $random is not specified then
the random mode is toggled.


=item $mpd->fade( [$seconds] )

Enable crossfading and set the duration of crossfade between songs.
If $seconds is not specified or $seconds is 0, then crossfading is disabled.

=back


=head2 Controlling playback

=over 4

=item $mpd->play( [$song] )

Begin playing playlist at song number $song. If no argument supplied,
resume playing.


=item $mpd->playid( [$songid] )

Begin playing playlist at song ID $songid. If no argument supplied,
resume playing.


=item $mpd->pause( [$state] )

Pause playback. If C<$state> is 0 then the current track is unpaused,
if $state is 1 then the current track is paused.

Note that if C<$state> is not given, pause state will be toggled.


=item $mpd->stop()

Stop playback.


=item $mpd->next()

Play next song in playlist.


=item $mpd->prev()

Play previous song in playlist.


=item $mpd->seek( $time, [$song])

Seek to $time seconds in song number $song. If $song number is not specified
then the perl module will try and seek to $time in the current song.


=item $mpd->seekid( $time, $songid )

Seek to $time seconds in song ID $songid. If $song number is not specified
then the perl module will try and seek to $time in the current song.

=back


=head2 Searching the collection

To search the collection, use the C<collection()> accessor, returning the
associated C<Audio::MPD::Collection> object. You will then be able to call:

    $mpd->collection->random_song();

See C<Audio::MPD::Collection> documentation for more details on available
methods.


=head2 Handling the playlist

To update the playlist, use the C<playlist()> accessor, returning the
associated C<Audio::MPD::Playlist> object. You will then be able to call:

    $mpd->playlist->clear;

See C<Audio::MPD::Playlist> documentation for more details on available
methods.
