=attr host

The hostname where MPD is running. Defaults to environment var
C<MPD_HOST>, then to 'localhost'. Note that C<MPD_HOST> can be of
the form C<password@host:port> (each of C<password@> or C<:port> can
be omitted).

=attr port

The port that MPD server listens to. Defaults to environment var
C<MPD_PORT>, then to parsed C<MPD_HOST> (cf above), then to 6600.

=attr password

The password to access special MPD functions. Defaults to environment
var C<MPD_PASSWORD>, then to parsed C<MPD_HOST> (cf above), then to
empty string.

=attr conntype

Change how the connection to mpd server is handled. It should be of a
C<CONNTYPE> type (cf L<Audio::MPD::Types>). Use either the C<reuse>
string to reuse the same connection or C<once> to open a new connection
per command (default).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Audio::MPD;

    my $mpd = Audio::MPD->new;
    $mpd->play;
    sleep 10;
    $mpd->next;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Audio::MPD> gives a clear object-oriented interface for talking to and
controlling MPD (Music Player Daemon) servers. A connection to the MPD
server is established as soon as a new L<Audio::MPD> object is created.

Since mpd is still in 0.x versions, L<Audio::MPD> sticks to latest mpd
(0.15 as time of writing) protocol & behaviour, and does B<not> try to
maintain backward compatibility.

Note that the module will by default connect to mpd before sending any
command, and will disconnect after the command has been issued. This
scheme is far from optimal, but allows us not to care about timeout
disconnections. Because of that, the C<idle> command (new in mpd 0.14)
is B<not> (and will not) be supported in L<Audio::MPD>. This will be
implemented in L<POE::Component::Client::MPD>.

B</!\> Note that L<Audio::MPD> is using high-level, blocking sockets.
This means that if the mpd server is slow, or hangs for whatever reason,
or even crash abruptly, the program will be hung forever in this sub.
The L<POE::Component::Client::MPD> module is way safer - you're advised
to use it instead of L<Audio::MPD>. Or you can try to set C<conntype> to
C<$REUSE> (see L<Audio::MPD> constructor for more details), but you
would be then on your own to deal with disconnections.


=head2 Searching the collection

To search the collection, use the C<collection()> accessor, returning the
associated L<Audio::MPD::Collection> object. You will then be able to call:

    $mpd->collection->all_songs;

See L<Audio::MPD::Collection> documentation for more details on available
methods.


=head2 Handling the playlist

To update the playlist, use the C<playlist()> accessor, returning the
associated L<Audio::MPD::Playlist> object. You will then be able to call:

    $mpd->playlist->clear;

See L<Audio::MPD::Playlist> documentation for more details on available
methods.
