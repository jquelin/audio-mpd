=head1 NAME

mpd-dynamic - a dynamic playlist for mpd


=head1 USAGE

    mpd-dynamic


=head1 VERSION

This is mpd-dynamic version 0.1


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program implements a dynamic playlist for mpd.

MPD (music player daemon) is a cool music player, but it lacks a dynamic
playlist. A dynamic playlist is a playlist that will change automatically
over time.

In particular, it will remove already played songs (keeping at most a given
number) and add new songs to the playlist so it never fall short of songs.

Note that since mpd is a daemon needing no gui to work, C<mpd-dynamic> is
also a daemon. That is, it will fork and do all its work from the background.
This way, you can fire C<mpd> and C<mpd-dynamic> and forget completely
about your music (especially since C<mpd-dynamic> is a low-resource program):
it will just be there! :-)


=head1 OPTIONS

=item -c[onf] <file>

Path of configuration file. Defaults to C<~/.mpd/mpd-dynamic.conf>.

=for Euclid:
    file.type:     readable
    file.default:  "$ENV{HOME}/.mpd/mpd-dynamic.conf"


=item -o[ld] <old>

Number of old tracks to keep in the backlog. Defaults to 10.

=for Euclid:
    old.type:     integer >= 0
    old.default:  10


=item -n[ew] <new>

Number of new tracks to keep in the to-be-played playlist. Defaults to 10.

=for Euclid:
    new.type:     integer > 0
    new.default:  10


=item -d[ebug]

Run mpd-dynamic in debug mode. In particular, the program will not daemonize
itself.
